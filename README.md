# Tutoring Website
A website to host a tutoring request and sign up form. When the sign up form is filled, the information will be saved in a database, and when a request form is filled, the information will be checked against those in the database for any matches. If there are any matches then emails will be sent to both parties stating things such as time, location, information on each other as well as the topic/subject of tutoring.  

## Deployment for Development
To run the website, simply run `python manage.py runserver` after installing from the Pipfile
